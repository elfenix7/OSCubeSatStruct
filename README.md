# OSCubeSatStruct
Parts and Testing Repository for the design of an Opensource CubeSat Structure implementing an endplate and rails architecture
SolidWorks CAD files were modeled under a student license of that program and have the associated watermark and use restrictions as set by Dassault Systemes. This license overrides all subsidiary ones. 
CAD and simulation files are provided under a CERN-OHL-P V2 licence. This is a permissive opensource license that allows derivative works with attribution, and does not require those works to then be made opensource. While it is desired that derivatives and improvements be shared to the broader community, it is understood that some CubeSat teams will not desire or be able to share their designs openly. The design and documentation are distributed without any express or implied warranty, including of merchantability, satisfactory quality, or fitness for a particular purpose.  Please see CERN-OHL-P V2 for applicable conditions. https://cern-ohl.web.cern.ch/home
